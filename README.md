# Leaflet-Challenge

Import & Visualize the Data

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

Create a legend that will provide context for map data.

Plot a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.

Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

Add layer controls to the map.
